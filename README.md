# Bank Account Management System – Core Java (Console Application)

A simple console-based banking application built using Core Java.  
This project allows users to create and manage bank accounts with basic operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.  
The main goal of this project is to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java.
